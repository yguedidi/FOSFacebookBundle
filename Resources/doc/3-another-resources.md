Avoiding redirect to Facebook login page
----------------------------------------

When you're using only Facebook as your firewall and a user goes to a protected page on your application 
without being logged in, they will be redirected to the Facebook login page.
If you want to avoid this behavior and redirect the user to another page, you can set this option on the ```security.yml```, as the example above:

```yaml
firewalls:
	public:
		...
		yg_facebook:
			...
			redirect_to_facebook_login: false
```

When you set this option, any request not authenticated will be redirected to the default login page.
